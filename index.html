                <p>I created a solar system with dynamic physics in OpenGL using C++. OpenGL is a graphics library that lets users create GPU programs called shaders, which are incredibly optimized to run on the GPU and are completely programable, making them very flexible and powerful. </p>
                <p>Notable features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dynamic orbital physics with second order numerical integration</li>
                    <li>WASD, mouse, up, down, and roll movement</li>
                    <li>control over speed of ojbects</li>
                    <li>Blinn-Phong lighting</li>
                    <li>Shadow maps</li>
                    <li>Spotlights</li>
                    <li>Skybox</li>
                    <li>Models</li>
                    <li>Bloom</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This project significantly enhanced my system-level understanding of computing, as it involved close interaction with the GPU and necessitated optimizations to achieve a reasonable framerate. A key aspect of my learning was becoming meticulous in managing object pointers, which was essential for robust software architecture. Additionally, this was a creative project for me, boosting my confidence to tackle imaginative projects in the future.</p>
                <p>Key Achievements and Learning Outcomes</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In-depth Software Design Knowledge: The project demanded a profound understanding of software design principles. My approach was characterized by thorough organization and the strategic application of fundamental programming concepts, such as inheritance, which I used extensively to share functionality among various classes, including those representing suns, planets, and models.</li>
                    <li>Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): This endeavor was possibly the most intensive application of OOP principles in my experience, requiring careful class design and hierarchy management to ensure code efficiency and maintainability.</li>
                    <li>Resourcefulness and Independence: Executing this project solo required me to seek out resources independently, continually adding features and deepening my understanding of OpenGL. This autonomy greatly bolstered my confidence and prepared me for future complex projects.</li>
                    <li>Problem-Solving in Unique Scenarios: The project presented unique challenges, especially in the later stages, such as optimizing bloom effects and tackling niche issues. These situations often led me to explore obscure resources to find solutions that were not readily apparent. Furthermore, shader development posed its own set of challenges, as the absence of conventional debugging tools like print statements demanded creative strategies to diagnose issues.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The project extensively leveraged object-oriented programming and inheritance, enhancing my understanding of sophisticated software design techniques.</li>
                    <li>As one of the most demanding projects early in my academic career, it provided invaluable experience in independent project management.</li>
                    <li>The unique challenges encountered, primarily visual anomalies in the output images, honed my problem-solving skills. This was critical as the project was completed during the first semester of my second year, a formative stage in my development.</li>
                    <li>Navigating these challenges required creative approaches to research and solution development, further strengthening my technical acumen.</li>
                </ul>
