                <p>I created a solar system with dynamic physics in OpenGL using C++. OpenGL is a graphics library that lets users create GPU programs called shaders, which are incredibly optimized to run on the GPU and are completely programable, making them very flexible and powerful. </p>
                <p>Notable features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dynamic orbital physics with second order numerical integration</li>
                    <li>WASD, mouse, up, down, and roll movement</li>
                    <li>control over speed of ojbects</li>
                    <li>Blinn-Phong lighting</li>
                    <li>Shadow maps</li>
                    <li>Spotlights</li>
                    <li>Skybox</li>
                    <li>Models</li>
                    <li>Bloom</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This project helped me attain a system-level understanding of the computer by working closely with GPU and needing to apply optimizations to maintain a reasonable framerate. I also needed to become very diligent in managing pointers to objects. I needed a very intimate understanding of the concepts and techniques of software design. This vast project required excellent organizational skills, and I needed to employ many fundamental programming concepts to make the project flow smoothly. An example is that I used inheritance extensively in this project since many classes share similar functionality, especially the suns, planets, and models. This project is probably the most I've ever used  OOP concepts.</p>
                <p>This project was entirely individual, requiring me to find my own resources to continue adding features and learning about OpenGL, which was a great experience and made me much more confident to tackle challenging projects like this in the future. Towards the end of the project, many features and optimizations I faced were niche, such as bloom optimizations, forcing me to find obscure resources that hardly fit my project to get by. This leads to the next learning goal I met: developing effective problem-solving skills. Problem-solving in shaders is exceptionally difficult, requiring me to get creative to find issues since there are no print statements in GLSL. Additionally, since I made this program in C++ and used pointers frequently, I encountered segmentation faults almost constantly, which are incredibly difficult to debug, and this gave me great experience solving complex problems.</p>

            <div class="project-text">
                <p>This project was my first experience with computer graphics. I made this ray tracer using Python and minimal third-party libraries. Some notable features include support for multiple objects, smooth shading, triangle meshes, directional and point lights, Phong Lighting, shadows, and 3D transformations.</p>
                <p>This project was a significant milestone in my computer science academic career because it was one of the most challenging projects I faced at the time. I was unfamiliar with the mathematics required for this project, which forced me to do my own extensive research to eventually get it working.</p>
                <p>Goals: This project made great use of object-oriented programming and inheritance, which helped me understand the concepts and techniques of software design. This project was a massive undertaking for me then, which gave me experience working individually on a project. Since the challenges in this program were unique, this project made me better at problem-solving in general, which is great because I did this project in the first semester of my second year. Most of the issues I encountered in this project were visual anomalies with the images, requiring me to be creative with how I would find more information about these issues.</p>

                <p>This project taught me how to develop in groups, as well as how to maintain a large project.</p>
                <p>Goals: The main goal learning goal this project fulfills is acquiring significant experience working in groups. I came into this project with a head start because I already knew some Unity, and I could assign group members various tasks so that we could all put our skills to use. I also made 58% of all commits. Since this was a large project with some advanced features, I also improved my understanding of software design techniques. I tackled several UI elements in this project and created a leaderboard using a database, greatly expanding my skillset. Additionally, I was required to solve complex problems because I was working with more than just my code and problem-solving for issues involving the database I'd never faced before.</p>

                <p>The Minijava compiler mimics the behavior of the Java compiler, but all the logic is built from scratch. The primary technology I used was ANTLR, and some of the key features include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Class and block structure (flow control)</li>
                    <li>JVM assembly code generation</li>

                <p>Goals: This project primarily helped me achieve a greater system-level understanding of the computer. This was one of the most complex projects I've ever done, and there were several weeks where my team and I would get together and spend more than 20 hours on it in a week. This gave me significant experience working with others. This project also generated some of the most mind-boggling errors I've ever encountered, and this project is mainly responsible for most of my current debugging/problem-solving skills.</p>
